/*
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define 
a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about 
any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

Use the Observer pattern when changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects, and the 
actual set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.
