/*
Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce 
chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts 
direct communications between the objects and forces them 
to collaborate only via a mediator object.

The Mediator pattern suggests that you should cease all direct 
communication between the components which you want to make 
independent of each other. 
Instead, these components must collaborate indirectly, 
by calling a special mediator object that redirects 
the calls to appropriate components. As a result, the components depend only on a single mediator class instead of being coupled to dozens of their colleagues.

Use the Mediator pattern when itâ€™s hard to change some of the classes 
because they are tightly coupled to a bunch of other classes.
